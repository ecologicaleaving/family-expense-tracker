/// ## Monthly Budget Reset Behavior (Feature 004)
///
/// **IMPORTANT**: Budgets do NOT reset automatically via code or database triggers.
/// Instead, budget "reset" is achieved implicitly through date-based queries:
///
/// 1. **Budget Storage**: Each budget record stores `month` and `year` fields
///    (e.g., month=1, year=2026 for January 2026)
///
/// 2. **Implicit Reset**: When a new month begins:
///    - Queries filter by current month/year (via RPC functions)
///    - Previous month's spending automatically becomes inaccessible
///    - Budget amounts remain the same, but spent amounts start at 0
///
/// 3. **RPC Implementation**: Budget stats RPC functions use date-based queries:
///    ```sql
///    WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM e.date) = p_month
///      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM e.date) = p_year
///    ```
///
/// 4. **Multi-Month Tracking**: Each month's budget is independent:
///    - January 2026 budget: €500 budgeted, €300 spent
///    - February 2026 budget: €500 budgeted, €0 spent (new month)
///    - Historical data remains queryable by specifying past month/year
///
/// 5. **Timezone Handling**: All date comparisons use UTC timezone to ensure
///    consistent month boundaries across different user timezones
///    (see [TimezoneHandler] for details)
///
/// This approach provides several benefits:
/// - No scheduled jobs or maintenance required
/// - Historical budget data preserved automatically
/// - Month boundaries handled correctly across timezones
/// - Query performance optimized via indexed date columns
